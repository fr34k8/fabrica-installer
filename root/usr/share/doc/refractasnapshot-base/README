Refracta Snapshot creates a bootable live-CD image which is a copy of
your running system. Any changes you make to the running system, 
including desktop preferences, configuration changes, or added software
will be copied to the snapshot and will be present when you run that
snapshot as a live system.

See the config file, /etc/refractasnapshot.conf for setting options.

See the excludes file, /usr/lib/refractasnapshot/snapshot_exclude.list
to examine which files and directories will not be copied to the 
snapshot. Edit the file as needed, either by adding items or commenting
out listed items that you want copied.

As of version 9.0.8, you can edit the config and excludes files from
within the gui program by choosing "Setup".

To run the script:

	refractasnapshot
or
	refractasnapshot-gui
	
or use the full path if needed:
	/usr/bin/refractasnapshot(-gui)
