# This file contains some configuration variables for (version 0.0.2)
# fabrica Snapshot (2014  CLI versions). If you want to change
# the defaults, this is the place to do it.
#
# Put this file in /etc or edit the configfile variable found at the
# top of refractasnapshot to reflect its true location. If the
# script can't find this config file, it'll use the default values.

# Default location for error log is /var/log/fabrica_snapshot_errors.log

error_log="/var/log/fabrica_snapshot_errors.log"


# You can change the location of $work_dir (location of system copy) and
# $snapshot_dir (location of final iso file) in case you don't have enough
# space on the system. (Defaults are "/home/work" and "/home/snapshot")
#
# Hints:
#   Be sure to use separate directories for these two variables. If you
# use the same location for both (e.g. /media/disk) and if $save_work
# is set to "no", your CD image will get deleted when the program
# finishes. Instead, use something like /media/disk/snapshot and
# /media/disk/work, or even /media/disk/snapshot/work.
#   These directories will be created by the script, and they are
# already set to be excluded from the rsync copy of the system (so you
# don't end up with an extra copy of your system or old snapshots in the
# final CD image.)
#   Any filesystems mounted in /mnt or /media will be excluded from the
# system copy. Filesystems mounted elsewhere will be included and will
# increase the size of the final CD image. To avoid that, you can either
# unmount those filesystems before running fabrica_snapshot, or you can
# add them to the excludes file. (See snapshot_excludes below.)

snapshot_dir="/var/lib/vz/fabrica-snapshot"
work_dir="/var/lib/vz/fabrica-work"


# Change $save_work to "yes" if you want the temporary copy of your
# filesystem to be saved. This will make subsequent snapshot creation
# go faster.
# (Default is "no")

save_work="no"


# You can change the default rsync excludes file here if you know what
# you're doing. Be sure to use the full path to the file.
#
# It's also possible to edit the excludes file by choosing "Setup"
# during the execution of the script.
#
# Default is "/usr/lib/fabrica_snapshot/snapshot_exclude.list"

snapshot_excludes="/usr/lib/fabrica_snapshot/snapshot_exclude.list"


# Change this if you want the live system to use other than the default
# kernel and initrd. You may need to edit the isolinux boot menu to
# match the filenames. (See custom boot menu section below.)
# (Defaults are /vmlinuz and /initrd.img)

kernel_image="/vmlinuz"

# Multiple snapshots (iso files) are named with the date and time of
# creation. If you prefer to have them numbered sequentially, comment
# out the next line. Default is to keep the line uncommented.

stamp="datetime"


# The name of the snapshot file will be snapshot-{date or number}.iso.
# If you'd like to replace "snapshot" with something more memorable,
# change it here. (example: snapshot_basename="fabrica-nox-wheezy")

snapshot_basename="fabrica-ve"


# Change to "no" if you don't want the md5sum file created with the iso.
# (Default is "yes")

make_md5sum="yes"


# Change to "no" if you want a plain iso image instead of isohybrid.
# (Default is "yes")

# Uncomment below to use xz compression for smaller iso. S-l-o-w.
# (*not* for standard Squeeze squashfs-tools)

# Stop clamav-freshclam from running automatically on live iso. You can

# Custom boot menu and help files section.

# If you're running fabrica_snapshot on some linux distribution other
# than fabrica, you should edit the boot menu, so that the boot menu
# reflects the correct distribution. You might also want to edit or
# remove some of the help files in the isolinux directory. (f1.txt,
# f2.txt...)
# If you want those changes to persist between runs, you should create
# a custom iso/isolinux directory, and set iso_dir (below) to point
# to that directory.


# Change to "yes" if you want to be able to view or edit the boot menu
# or any other config files before the final image is made.
# Note2: For SolusOS and possibly others, boot entries should contain
# "union=unionfs" in place of "union=aufs".

# EDITOR SETTINGS
# This gets used if you set edit_boot_menu="yes" or if you run setup
# and choose to edit the config file or the excludes file.
# Use an absolute path here.

# Command-line editor (for fabrica_snapshot)
text_editor="/usr/bin/nano"

# Graphical editor (for fabrica_snapshot-gui)
# Program tests for geany, gedit, kate, kwrite, leafpad, medit, mousepad
# You can specify an editor here if needed.
# other_editor_option is used to force a new instance of the editor.

# You can change iso_dir if you want to use customized files for the
# boot menu and boot help pages on the live-cd.
# Note:
# If you're using custom versions (different from what's installed
# on your system) of isolinux.bin and vesamenu.c32, you'll need to edit
# or comment out the rsync commands in the script that copy these two
# files from your system to the work directory. To find the lines, see
# /usr/bin/fabrica_snapshot or /usr/bin/refractsnapshot-gui right after
# the line that says "The real work starts here."
#
# (Default is "/usr/lib/fabrica_snapshot/iso")
# DO NOT USE A TRAILING SLASH HERE!!!"
